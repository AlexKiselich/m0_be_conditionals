# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Pretty confident. It seems pretty straight-forward

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Pretty confident.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
These seem a little more complex but I feel much more confident then when I started the lesson

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent an hour and 30 min or so on the topic. A little longer than expected but I wanted to do the spicy challenge so it took me a little longer to do some more research but I did love that part!

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think I can keep practicing really everything. I want it to become second nature to me. I have practice/review time in my Calendar already

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I would like to know how much time and practice a turing grad still spends on these topics? Do they just remeber it all or do they have an idea but sometimes need to review to stay sharp? I will ask my small group leader his advice.
